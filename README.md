# Fun With Fantasy Football

The motivation behind this project is to acquire experience working with extracting data from multiple sources, creating a database that houses said data, and displaying the results by serving the data in the form of a RESTful API using Flask. I hope to integrate more technologies and features as time goes on, for instance, using a scheduler (Airflow) to periodically acquire/update tables in the database.
