# FFDataExploration

The motivation behind this project is to acquire experience working with acquiring data from multiple sources, creating a database that houses said data with read/write capabilities, and displaying the results in the form of a RESTful API using Flask. I hope to integrate more technologies and features as time goes on, for instance, using a scheduler (Airflow) to periodically acquire/update tables in the database.
